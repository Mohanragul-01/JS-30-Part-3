# JS-30-Part-3

This is the final set of 10 projects from the [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) course by Wes Bos. These advanced challenges explore browser APIs, event handling techniques, and interactive UI patterns, pushing the limits of what can be built with pure JavaScript.

### Links to the challenges I completed:

01. Geolocation - https://geolocation-tau-eight.vercel.app/

02. Follow Along Link Highlighter - https://follow-along-link-highlighter-seven.vercel.app/

03. Speech Synthesis - https://speech-synthesis-five.vercel.app/

04. Sticky Nav - https://sticky-nav-delta.vercel.app/

05. Event Capture, Propagation, Bubbling and Once - https://event-capture-propagation-bubbling-and-once.vercel.app/

06. Stripe Follow Along Nav - https://stripe-follow-along-nav.vercel.app/

07. Click and Drag - https://click-and-drag.vercel.app/

08. Video Speed Controller - https://video-speed-controller-teal.vercel.app/

09. Countdown Timer - https://countdown-timer-gilt-eight.vercel.app/

10. Whack A Mole - https://whack-a-mole-gold-five.vercel.app/

This final batch of projects strengthened my understanding of how JavaScript interacts with complex browser features like geolocation, speech synthesis, custom event handling, and building smooth user experiencesâ€”all without any libraries or frameworks.

All projects are deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for easy access and sharing.

Completing all 30 projects has been a great hands-on journey through modern JavaScript!
